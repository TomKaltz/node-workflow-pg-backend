A backend for [node-workflow](http://kusor.github.com/node-workflow/) built
over [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).

Note this module uses JSON PostgreSQL data type. A version of PostgreSQL
supporting this datatype is thereby required (9.3+).

# Installation

npm install wf-pg-backend

# Usage

Add the following to the config file of your application using wf:

    {
      "backend": {
        "module": "wf-pg-backend",
        "opts": {
          "port": 5432,
          "host": "localhost",
          "database:": "node_workflow",
          "user": "postgres",
          "password": ""
        }
      }
    }

Where all the values are obviously related to your PostgreSQL server config.

If any of your configuration values matches the ones on the block
above, you don't need to specify them since those are the default values.

Please, note that this module will not try to create the `database` especified,
it must exists in order to be used by this module.

And that should be it. `wf` REST API and Runners should take care of
properly loading the module on init.


# TODO:
- Update types so everything requiring a JSON objects is of JSON type instead
  of TEXT.
